    "The class FiniteAutomata contains the instance variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- start_state the starting state\n",
    "- final_states a set of states that are all the final states\n",
    "- transitions a dictionary with keys the pairs (symbol,state) and value state\n",
    "\n",
    "It is intended that symbols are simple characters such as upper and lower case letters, numbers, and perhaps the dash and undescore. The states are names by strings of these characters. The character \":\" is reserved to represent the epsilon, if this were a non-deterministic finite automata. Although this implmementation is for a deterministic finite automata, so transitions on symbol \":\" are not used, the syntax is provided for future coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "A parser takes a description and fills in the the instance variables of an instance of class FiniteAutomata. Then the FA is simulated on an string by working symbol by symbol in the string and looking for a matching transition, updating the state with each symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the machine is deterministic, if a required (symbol,state) is not a key in the transition dictionary, the automata fails. Also, only one value is permited for any (symbol,state) key.\n",

    "- If the first character of the line after whitespace is #, the entire line is a comment\n",
    "- Stanza's begin with a tag-name in column 1, a colon, and an argument; stanza's continue with a non-empty line begining with whitespace.\n",
    "- The start stanza has tag-name \"start\" and one argument and no continuation lines. The argument names the start state.\n",
    "- The final stanza has tag-name \"final\" and one argument naming one of the final states. Continuation lines name additional final states, one per continuation line.\n",
    "- The state stanza has tag-name \"state\" and one argumrnt naming the source state to be combined with symbol-state pairs named in the continuation lines. Continuation lines have two arguments, a symbol and a state, one line per transition. \n",
